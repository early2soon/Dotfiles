*the steps of installing minimal debian-i3 (no DE)for productivity:
-for installing minimal debian-i3 see "./Documents/debian-stable-i3 installation.txt"

-For changing the resolution get to lightdm config in "/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf" and add the following line after [Seat:*], so it should be:
[Seat:*]
display-setup-script=xrandr -s 1360x768

-Install terminal of your choice:
for example: sudo apt install xfce4-terminal
-Install gcc:
sudo apt install gcc
-Install gnu make and other essentials:
sudo apt-get install build-essential
-Install network manager (NetworkManager):
sudo apt install network-manager
-Minimal i3wm config (~./.config/i3/config) will be uploaded later on Github
-Minimal vimrc config (~./.vimrc) will also be uploaded on Github
-Install vim-gtk3 for enabling global clipboarding in vim:
sudo apt-get install vim-gtk3 -y

-if you want to add a vim configuration command in vimrc without erasing the deafult configuration simply put this at the start of your vimrc:
runtime defaults.vim

-new cli based file manager that works well with vim: ranger
sudo apt install ranger

-Install power-manager software (xfce4-power-manager or TLP) and add auto startup command at boot in i3 config
