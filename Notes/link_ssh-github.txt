linking github account and ssh to a new machine:
1- generate a new ssh key:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
!NOTE:
this command will generate two keys (public and private key) to this directory by default: 
~/.ssh/id_ed25519	   	for the private key
~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  	for the public key


2- add the generated key to your ssh-agent:
-start the agent:
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
-add the private ssh key (replace id_ed25519 with the actual id in your directory):
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
3- add the public ssh key to your Github account:
-go to Settings=>SSH and GPG keys=>New SSH key
-copy the SSH public key:
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

4- add Github fingerprint to known hosts:
-If we try to clone a repository we will get the following error:
"The authenticity of host 'github.com' can't be established. RSA key fingerprint"
-to fix this lets add Github fingerprint to our known_hosts file:
ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
